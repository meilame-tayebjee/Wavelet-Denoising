# Signal Denoising using Wavelet Transform and Thresholding

MVA 23-24 Course Machine Learning for Time Series (L. Oudre)

Based on the paper _An Iterative Wavelet Threshold for Signal Denoising_ by F. M. Bayer, A. J. Kozakevicius and R. J. Cintra (article available in the repo: Wavelet-Denoising.pdf.

We reimplement and apply the method to ECG signal that we noise ourselves (as in _Performance Study of Different Denoising Methods_ by M. Almahamdy & H. B. Riley, paper available in the repo) for ECG signals. We compare to baselines. 
All of our results are explained and detailed in the report also available in the repository.

- ECG-noising-denoising.ipynb contains all the main results. It is directly "runnable".
